HTTP VERB EXAMPLES

The word "Record" usually means an item in the database

GET => Used to get information
POST => Used to create new records
PUT => Used to update existing records
DELETE => Used to delete records
PATCH?
HEAD?
Others?

All of these examples do the same thing, but
using different HTTP verbs

Only GET works easily from a browser URL
curl localhost:8080/example1

curl - X PUT localhost:8080/example1

curl - X POST localhost:8080/example1

curl - X DELETE localhost:8080/example1


Try curl with localhost:8080/example2?number=100

EXERCISES:
1. Write something about yourself and return it to the browser

- Register a "/my_info" handler
- Write your name and something about yourself as output


2. Random number generator
- Create an endpoint that picks a random number and shows it

3. Display current time and date at "/now"

4. Fizzbuzz:
This is the infamous fizzbuzz problem
All software devs should be comfortable solving this
in an interview setting on a whiteboard

The fizzbuzz problem has the following requirements:

When a number is a multiple of 3, print fizz
When a number is a multiple of 5, print buzz
When a number is a multiple of 3 and 5, print fizzbuzz

Create an endpoint "/fizzbuzz" that has all numbers from 1 to to a query parameter that match the above rules

So localhost:8080/fizzbuzz/?limit=100 would do fizzbuzz from 0 to 100
